### The "hunted" game in various styles

#### Core Ideas (this is work in progress; early draft below)

Here are some definitions of core terms, as used in the Kojo/Scala world.  
You might see different definitions elsewhere (so don't get hung up on the words; what's important is the ideas behind the words).

* Everything in Scala is an object.
* Objects contain data/fields and code/methods.
* Objects can be of the following kinds:
  * Value objects - these are made of immutable data. They represent values/quantities in the world being modelled.
  * Mutable data objects - these provide a way of storing changable data in a program.
  * Entity objects - these contain mutable data (their state) and behavior (via methods) that acts on the state. They represent active entities in the world being modelled.  
  (Note - entity state can also be modelled as a mutable/changable reference to a value).

With the above definitions in place, here's an overview of the various versions of hunted:
